    <p>I am contacting you in hopes of putting me in contact with someone who could answer a few question concerning the webcam itself and the data process, perhaps with the person that was walking towards the webcam on the 8th of December 2015 at 16:10:08,and repositioned the camera at 16:18:15 making it so it has a slightly wider frame from 16:23:08 and forward.</p>

      <p> My name is Victoria Douka-Doukopoulou and I am currently conducting research in the development of noise patterns in CCD sensors. As part of my research I have been following, I might say a bit too closely, the webcam photographing the Neumayer Station III.

      <p>Dear Mrs. Maria Eden,</p>


      <p>I hope this email finds you well. </p>

      <p>My name is Victoria Douka-Doukopoulou and I am currently conducting research in the development of noise patterns in CCD sensors. As part of my research I have been following, I might say a bit too closely, the webcam photographing the Neumayer Station III.
      </p>

      <p>I have been trying to get in contact with someone, to ask a few questions concerning the webcam itself and the data process. I am contacting you in hopes of putting me in contact with said person.</p>

      <p>Particularly my questions are about the noise patterns created (?) captured (?) on the 31st of October 2015 from 15:40:09 to 17:09:16 local time. The photographs produced are either heavily spectacled with noise or completely grey. I also noticed, from the data distributed from your institution, that at the same time the local and global radiation measurements peaked. Is it possible that there is a connection between the two?</p>

      <p>Thank you in advance for your time and help,<br> Victoria Douka-Doukopoulou</p>

      <p>Dear Prof. Dr. Stephan Frickenhaus,</p>


      <p> I hope this email finds you well.</p>

      <p>My name is Victoria Douka-Doukopoulou and I am currently conducting research in the development of noise patterns in CCD sensors. I am particularly interested in moments where highly charged particles collide with the sensor. As is it extremely rare,I am trying to figure out if I indeed spotted such an incident captured by the live webcam photographing the Neumayer Station III.</p>

      <p>I would like to see if it is possible to find out whether the camera is a CCD or CMOS ? What is the data storage process ? And if the data are transmitted through wires or wirelessly ?</p>

      <p>I am contacting you as the head of the computing centre to see if you could answer my questions or if you could point towards the direction of someone who could.</p>


      <p>Thank you in advance for your time and help,<br> Victoria Douka-Doukopoulou</p>

I am contacting you as deputy of the atmospheric science department in hopes of putting me in contact with said person. I have already contacted all the administrative and secretarial staff, sadly no responses yet.</p>

      <p>Partially the reason why I think the sequence of the photographs captures such a collision is that at the same time the local and global radiation measurements peaked.</p>

      <p>It really looks like a high charged particle collides with the sensor at 15:40:09 making it overcharge and blow out the photograph, and the sensor tries to process the extra current making so over that over the period the next 7 photographs it slowly recovers and start to be able to capture information again.</p>
