    <p>I have sat down and built myself a loom. <br> I sit on it day and night and I weave the invisible. <br> I make carpets, and blankets and tapestries.<br> and then I write you letters with instructions<br> on how to see them.<br> I am writing you now, to make plans for you <br> to come and see my tapestries.<br>
    </p>
    <p>acatalog.allthingsinvisible.online complies stories of the<br>
       invisible, the unthinkable and the inappreciable.<br> </p>
      <p>the installation of the three-fold catalog indexes scores for a<br>
         performative lecture, a documentary and an archive that <br>
         can never be actualised as their building material is the <br>
        invisible itself.</p>
    <p>the catalog is mainly words â€” technical words, english words <br>
       motivated by the sensitivity of practicing the art of <br>
      noticing, of looking for traces and ways of knowing <br>
      and world making.</p>
