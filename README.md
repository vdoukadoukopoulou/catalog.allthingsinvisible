# a catalog of all things invisible 


I have sat down and built myself a loom.
I sit on it day and night and I weave the invisible.
I make carpets, and blankets and tapestries.
and then I write you letters with instructions on how to see them. 
I am writing you now, to make plans for you to come and see my tapestries.



A catalog of all things invisible complies stories of the invisible, the unthinkable and the inappreciable. The installation of the three-fold catalog indexes scores for a performative lecture, a documentary and an archive that can never been actualised as their building material is the invisible itself. 
The catalog is mainly words â€” technical words, english words motivated by the sensitivity of practicing the art of noticing, of looking for traces and ways of knowing and world making.
